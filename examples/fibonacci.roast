# Fibonacci sequence generator - WORKING VERSION
roast n is 10 ~
roast a is 0 ~
roast b is 1 ~

burn "Fibonacci Sequence:" ~

# Use WHILE loop instead of FOR (more reliable)
roast counter is 0 ~

keep going while (counter < n)
    burn a ~
    roast temp is a + b ~
    roast a is b ~
    roast b is temp ~
    roast counter is counter + 1 ~
